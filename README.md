# Cancer Detection with Siamese Networks and Bagging experimental approach in Pytorch

Challenge: https://iciar2018-challenge.grand-challenge.org/home/

Our approach to PART A of the challenge posted above.

We have a custom dataset created "SiameseBaggingDataset" which we use and then we have our tests. The ipynb has been formulated for easy understanding and navigation. NOTE: Since our approach takes a comparison with training data during test(considering a siamese comparison) but WE DO NOT USE TEST LABELS except for generating prediction score.
